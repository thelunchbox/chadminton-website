      <div class="content">
        It all started back in 2004 in a little town called Troy, Ohio.
        Chadminton was first conceived by bored high school students who thought
        lacrosse looked like an interesting sport but had no access to play.
        After several prototypes and a move to Ohio State, Chadminton finally
        made its debut when seven college students first put pillow to scoop in
        2006. From there, Chadminton slowly began to build momentum, gaining
        more and more players. By 2009, students were able to participate in a
        legitimate Chadminton intramural league. At its peak, the OSU Chadminton
        club had over 50 active members!

      <div class="content" style="margin-top: 30px">
        Now we're in the midst of a Chadminton revolution - our group is back
        and better than ever. Come be a part of Chadminton history!

        Chadminton is born out of extreme boredom. High school students imagined
        a game like lacrosse that was inexpensive, but also wanted to add twists
        to make it different. This led to the idea of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">chad</span>, a player whose equipment
        differed radically from the rest of their teammates.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="date">March 2006</div>
        After a hiatus, new chadminton equipment was developed and tested.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="date">May 2006</div>
        The first chadminton game is finally played with seven people. Because
        of the odd number of players, a chadminton staple was born; the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">roaming chad</span> is a player who
        plays for neither team but merely causes chaos for both.

      <div class="content">

        Chadminton becomes a regular weekly activity among a group of friends,
        and establishes itself as a spring sport.

        The inaugural Chadminton Summer Conference and Tournament is held in
        Columbus, allowing players to come together over summer break to play
        Chadminton.

        The Chadminton Club at OSU is founded and begins the (long) process of
        becoming an official Ohio State organization. Following a reasonably
        successful trip to the OSU Involvement Fair, a handful of new recruits
        are brought in for a fall season of pickup games.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="date">March 2008</div>
        Chadminton continues its growth by hosting larger and larger pickup
        games throughout the spring, eventually reaching numbers too big for
        everyone to play at once.
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="date">September 2008</div>
        Another year of recruiting, another year of more and more people coming
        to play during the fall pickup games. It is decided that in the spring,
        the club will host its own recreational league.
