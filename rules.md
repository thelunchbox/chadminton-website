## 1. THE LADDER

1. Chadminton is played on a field called the **ladder**.
2. The ladder is a rectangle 150 feet long (between the **goal lines** on each short side) and 100 feet wide (between the **sidelines** on each long side).
3. The ladder is split into two halves by a line parallel to the goal lines which is 75 feet from both goal lines.
4. At the center of this **midline**, the center of the field, is the **faceoff dot**, around which there is a circle with a radius of 4 feet, which defines the **faceoff circle**.
    1. Each half is split in half once more by a line parallel to the midline at a distance of 37.5 feet. These are the **serving lines**.
5. The **goals** are placed with the face along the goal lines, and centered on each goal line, one at each end.
    1. The goals are 6 feet tall and 6 feet wide - the depth of the goals is of no consequence. Standard lacrosse goals may be used if available.
6. Along the goal lines, on either side of the goal, the **throw-in points** are 25 feet from the intersection of the goal line and sideline.
7. The **crease** of either goal is the area bound by the semi-circle centered at the midpoint of the goal line and extending into the field of play.

## 2. EQUIPMENT

1. Scoops are the main equipment used in chadminton, and have the following properties:
    1. The head consists of a "scoop toss" scoop, see this as an example.
    2. The head is attached to a schedule 40 PVC pipe handle.
        1. The handle is 36 inches long and has an inner diameter of 1/2".
        2. One end of the handle is covered by a PVC cap which is secured to the handle.
        3. The other end of the handle is attached to the head using screws.
    3. The head of the scoop is completely covered in at least one layer of duct tape.
        1. The duct tape must be, generally, flat against the surface of the scoop.
        2. Additional structures or protrusions may not be constructed from tape attached to the scoop.
        3. The tape on a scoop must not interfere with ball by making it more difficult for the ball to come out of the scoop.
        4. All tape on the scoop must not expose its adhesive side.
    4. The scoop handle may be covered in tape as well if desired - athletic tape is recommended to improve grip.
2. Pillows must be standard pillows of an average weight and sized for a full or queen bed set.
    1. No memory foam pillows may be used.
    2. No pillows with tassles, buttons, or other protuberances.
    3. Pillows must be contained within a pillowcase while being used.
3. Balls are hollow plastic balls with a circumference of around 10". These balls generally come with a "scoop toss" set (see rule 2.1.1).
    1. Balls must be covered with duct tape, according to the same standards used for taping scoops (see rule 2.1)
    2. Balls may be any color but it is recommended to use a bright, fluorescent color such as orange or pink to provide contrast with the grass and give the ball high-visibility.
    3. As a convention, balls should be striped in a pattern of 3 rings, intersecting at 6 points on the ball at 90-degree angles.
4. Goals (as stated in rule 1.5.1) are 6 feet tall and 6 feet wide.
    1. Standard lacrosse goals may be used when available.
    2. Otherwise, the frame of the goal should consist of a sturdy construction, such that it will not be easily moved if lightly bump or light winds prevail.
    3. The goal should have a net covering the back (not the face, of course) in order to restrict balls that enter the goal.
        1. This also makes it easier to see when a ball has entered the goal.
    4. The net should be secured to the goal in such a way that the ball cannot easily pass through the net through a gap.
5. Cones should be used to mark the intersections of the goal lines, sidelines, midline, and serving lines.
    1. Cones should also be used to mark the throw-in points.
    2. If possible, marking or striping paint should be used to mark the crease, the faceoff dot, and faceoff circle.

## 3. PLAYERS AND POSITIONS

1. Chadminton is played with teams of 4 to 7 players per side. The preferred number of players is 7, but when fewer players are available, a minimum of 4 players per side is necessary.
2. There are two categories of Chadminton players
    1. A **mintoner** is a player who carries a scoop.
    2. A **chad** is a player who carries a pillow.
        i. There is only one chad per team allowed on the field at a time.
3. There are four basic positions, any one of which may be played by either category of player. Players may switch positions as often as they like and there are no limits on the number of players at any position with the exception of the goalie (see rule 7.2 below).
    1. **Strikers** are primarily offensive players who focus on scoring goals.
    2. **Sweepers** are two-way players that focus on transitioning between offense and defense.
    3. **Defenders** are primarily defensive players who focus on stopping the opposition's offense and creating turnovers.
    4. **Goalies** reside in the crease and focus on blocking shots on goal.

## 4. GENERAL RULES FOR PLAYERS

1. Players may use their body as a shield in order to do any of the following:
    1. Blocking opposing defenders from advancing on their teammates.
    2. Blocking opposing players from advancing toward the goal or up the field.
2. Players may not deliberately hip-check, shoulder charge, or otherwise make aggressive contact with another player.
3. Players may not deliberately hit someone from the side or back.
4. Players may deflect the scoop or pillow of another player with an *open* hand, but they may not grab it.
5. Players may not kick a scoop or pillow.
    1. Lifting or deflecting a scoop with the foot is illegal and counts as a "kick".
6. Players may not kick a ball in play.
    1. Incidental contact with the foot does not necessarily mean the ball has been kicked, but deliberate kicking is not allowed.
    2. A player in isolation may kick the ball into their own scoop provided there are no players within 10 feet attempting to make 3 play on the ball.

## 5. MINTONERS

1. Mintoners can only move the ball using the scoop.
    1. The ball may be picked up from the ground using the scoop.
    2. The ball may be batted on the ground or in the air using the scoop.
    3. The ball may be caught in flight using the scoop.
2. They must always have their scoop in hand, unless it has been knocked away from them during the normal course of play.
    1. Any mintoner who has lost possession of their scoop may play without a scoop *only* if there is an immediate threat from the opposition i.e. if the player with the ball is in front of them are they are attempting to defend that player.
    2. Once the thread has been resolved, the player must retrieve their scoop.
    3. Mintoners may not throw their scoops.
    4. Mintoners may not pick up another players scoop.
3. Mintoners may user their scoop to defend by hitting the scoop of another mintoner
    1. Incidental contact with the player is allowed, but purposeful or repeated contact of this manner will result in a penalty or ejection (See section 9. PENALTIES below)
4. Mintoners may not hold or touch the head of the scoop (everything above the handle of the scoop)
5. When in posession of the ball, mintoners may not carry the scoop in such a way that the mouth of the scoop is blocked, thereby protecting the ball from becoming dislodged.

## 6. CHADS

1. Chads can only move the ball using the pillow.
    1. The ball may be struck on the ground using the pillow.
    2. The ball may be struck in the air using the pillow.
    3. The ball may land on the pillow and be carried, as long as the pillow is not folded around more than one third of the ball. Given that pillows are soft, the ball is expected to settle into the pillow by a small amount but the ball may not be held in place by pinching or folding the pillow around it.
2. Chads may throw their pillow.
    1. The pillow may be thrown at the ball in any state.
    2. The pillow may be thrown at any player or their scoop.
3. Chads may strike or contact other players with the pillow.
    1. Chads may strike any player (with the exception of a goalie in their crease).
    2. Chads may strike players in the body or face *from the front only*.
    3. Chads may hold the pillow against the body of another player and push them.

## 7. GOALIES

1. As mentioned in rule 3.3.4, a Goalie is only a goalie while they are inside the crease (see rule 1.7).
    1. "Inside the crease" is defined as any part of the player's body is within the crease.
2. Any player, with a scoop or a pillow, may become a goalie by entering their own unoccupied crease.
    1. Any player entering their own crease while it is occupied by a teammate is not considered the goalie until the *current* goalie vacates the crease entirely.
3. Goalies may use any part of their body to stop a shot or shot attempt.
4. If a goalie uses a part of their body to stop a shot, and they retain posession of the ball, the following rules apply:
    1. The goalie may not leave the crease until they have properly disposed of the ball and it has been touched by another player.
    2. The goalie may only dispose of the ball using the equipment they hold.
        1. If a mintoner is playing goalie, they must place the ball in their scoop and toss it.
        2. If a chad is playing goalie, they must strike the ball with the pillow.
5. If a goalie uses their scoop or pillow to stop a shot and does *not* use any body part, they may gain posession of the ball and vacate the crease, invalidating their goalie priviliges.
6. While the goalie is in the crease, no opposing player may touch them or their equipment.

## 8. SCORING AND SERVING

1. A goal shall be awarded to a team when the ball entirely crosses the goal line within the goal (see rule 1.5.1).
    1. It does not matter whether the goalie or any other player has posession of the ball - if it crosses the line entirely, the goal is awarded.
    2. In cases where we lack the means to properly judge whether the ball has cross the goal line within the goal, we will rely on the integrity of the closest player (usually the goalie) to determine.
2. After a score, the scoring team serves the ball to their opponent.
    1. The scoring team willplace the ball on their serving line.
    2. All players on the each team must position themselves on or behind their team's serving line.
    3. The ball must then be thrown to the receiving team and it must cross the midline. Valid forms of service include:
        1. Hitting or "scooping" the ball from the ground with a scoop.
        2. Picking up the ball and throwing it with a scoop.
        3. Tossing the ball into the air and hitting it with the pillow.
    4. The serving team may not come within 10 feet of the ball until it has been touched by the receiving team.
    5. If the ball should go out of bounds during service before being touched by the receiving team, the receiving team may take posession and advance the ball.
        1. In this scenario, the serving team may not cross the midline until the ball is advanced past the midline.

## 9. BOUNDARIES

1. The **boundary lines** are the goal lines and the sidelines.
2. The ball is considered **out of bounds** when one of the following has occurred:
    1. The ball is not in possession of a player and it is making contact with the ground completely outside of the playing area.
        1. If any part of the ball is making contact with any part of a boundary line, it is still *in bounds*.
    2. A player in possession of the ball is making contact with the ground completely outside of the playing area.
        1. If any part of the player in posession of the ball is making contact with any part of a boundary line, they are still *in bounds*.
    3. If a player is out of bounds without possession of the ball and the come in contact with a ball still in play, the ball will be called out of bounds.
    4. The team of the last player to touch the *ball* must surrender possession to the opposing team.
        1. If a player hits the scoop or pillow of another player, the player whose scoop or pillow last touched the ball is held responsible for the ball going out of bounds.
3. The ball is **side out** when it is out of bounds after crossing a sideline.
    1. The opposing team then selects a player to throw the ball back into play from the spot at which the ball when out of bounds.
    2. The ball must be thrown in within 10 seconds from when the ball is retrieved by the team taking possession.
4. The ball is **end out** when it is out of bounds after crossing a goal line.
    1. If the ball was last touched by the team who is *attacking* the goal on the goal line in question, the ball may be thrown in from the spot at which the ball went out of bounds.
        1. The ball must be thrown in within 10 seconds from when the ball is retrieved by the team taking possession.
    2. If the ball was last touched by the team who is *defending* the goal on the goal line in question, the ball must be thrown in at the *throw-in point* closest to where the ball went out of bounds.
        1. The ball must be thrown in within 15 seconds from when the ball is retrieved by the team taking posession.
        2. The ball must come into contact with another player or their equipment before entering the goal - otherwise, the ball is considered out of bounds under rule 9.4.1.

## 10. PENALTIES

1. There are three types of penalties.
    1. **Spot fouls** result in the opposing team taking possession of the ball at the location of the penalty.
        1. The team taking possession has 10 seconds to throw the ball.
        2. If the ball enters the goal without coming into contact with another player or their equipment, it is considered out of bounds under rule 9.4.1.
    2. **Gray points** result in the offending player being removed from the game for 2 minutes before they are allowed to return.
        1. Their team may not substitute another player in their place during these 2 minutes.
        2. Once the 2 minutes have expired, any player (including the offending player) may re-enter the game.
    3. **Ejections** are reserved for particularly egregious acts of aggression, violence, or malice.
2. Because in many cases referees are not present, we rely on players to self-police first and agree to group decisions when necessary.

## 11. FACEOFFS

1. Each period begins with a faceoff between the **chads**.
2. The ball is placed on the ground at the faceoff dot (the center point of the field).
3. Only the chads are permitted in the faceoff circle.
4. Players must stay on the side of the midline that they are defending until the ball has been touched.
